\section{\large Research}

My research focuses on \textbf{computer security} from a systems perspective. My graduate work has spanned censorship resistance, Internet protocol security, and embedded systems security.
I have exposed vulnerabilities in insecure electronic voting systems in the U.S. and abroad, developed detection techniques that uncovered weaknesses in widespread cryptographic protocol implementations, and created systems for circumventing large-scale Internet censorship in countries such as Iran and China.

\section{\large Broader\\Impact}

\textbf{\href{https://radsec.org}{Analysis of a Full Body Scanner}} (2014)\\
We revealed that X-ray backscatter full-body scanners previously used in airports were insufficient to detect the non-metallic threats they were specifically intended to find. This work raised serious questions about TSA's procedures for purchasing and deploying security technologies.

\textbf{\href{https://zmap.io/}{ZMap Internet-Wide Scanner}} (2013)\\
ZMap is an open-source, Internet-wide network scanner tool that is able to probe the entire IPv4 address space in under 45 minutes, over 1000 times faster than previous approaches. Now a major open-source project, it has been adopted widely by researchers performing Internet security measurement.

\textbf{\href{https://factorable.net/}{Detection of Widespread Weak Keys in Network Devices}} (2012)\\
By scanning the Internet for TLS and SSH hosts, we discovered that millions of embedded networked devices had generated weak cryptographic keys using insufficient entropy sources. We disclosed vulnerabilities to more than 60 network device makers and spawned major changes to the Linux kernel's random number generator.

\textbf{\href{https://telex.cc/}{Telex Anticensorship System}} (2011)\\
Telex is a fundamentally new form of censorship circumvention that places proxies in the middle of the network, at Internet service providers (ISPs) outside censoring countries.  This makes them difficult for censors to block without blocking large amounts of unrelated traffic. I'm now working with a large ISP to deploy a Telex testbed.\looseness=-1

\textbf{\href{http://indiaevm.org/}{Analysis of India's E-Voting System}} (2010)\\
We demonstrated low-tech attacks that could compromise India's nation-wide electronic voting machines, showing that the system was not tamperproof as the government claimed.  As a result, India is working to deploy new machines that add a paper audit trail, changing how the country votes.
