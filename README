Eric Wustrow's LaTeX Résumé
---------------------------

I'm putting this in github because I'm too lazy to set up a private github
repos, and I thought it'd be nice to track its changes over time.

I guess it would be kinda weird if people forked this, because more than
likely, you aren't me. Feel free to copy the style layout, or res.cls
(written by Michael DeCorte).

To build resume.pdf, run:
